High Performance Computing
High Performance Computing (HPC) plays an important role in both scientific advancement and economic competitiveness of a nation - making production of scientific and industrial solutions faster, less expensive, and of higher quality. HPC is a key component in many applications: designing vehicles and airplanes; designing high-rise buildings and bridges; discovery of drugs; discovery and extraction of new energy sources like oil and natural gas; weather forecasting; and many more.

Multilingual & Heritage Computing
India is a unique country in the world having 22 scheduled languages besides heritage languages and over one hundred widely used languages with different scripts. Despite a very impressive growth of computers and the Internet over the past few decades, most of the content on the Internet and most of the ICT based solutions in India are still available only in English. This is in stark contrast to the ground reality as hardly 10% of Indians use English as a language for communication. C-DAC realized long ago that penetration of IT to masses is possible in India only if we develop tools and technologies to overcome this language barrier. Hence, for over the last 25 years, C-DAC has been pursuing pioneering research in Language Technology and Heritage Computing.

Cyber Security & Forensics
Increased Internet penetration has given exponential rise in sophisticated attacks on Information Technology (IT) infrastructure. Attackers are gaining access to sensitive information like credit card details and other financial information. Smartphone attacks are growing in multiple folds. Also with the growth of 3G services and business transactions using mobile phones, there is a substantial increase in mobile malware. In order to make our IT infrastructure resilient against these threats, there is a need for cutting-edge Research and Development efforts in Cyber Security. C-DAC has been actively pursuing R & D in a number of sub-areas in Cyber Security domain.
Biometrics
Cyber Forensics
End Point Security

Education & Training
C-DAC's Education and Training programmes are aimed at creating skilled manpower in the country by providing quality training programmes in the field of Electronics and ICT. This activity started almost two decades ago with a humble beginning of training about 20 students per year, but has today grown to an extent of training more than 5000 students per year. It also grew from just one training centre to about 50 training centres across India and has even made its presence in several countries abroad. In addition to conducting wide range of training programmes in the areas of Information, Communication and Electronics technologies, C-DAC also develops ICT tools and technologies for modern methods of imparting education and training to masses. The Education and Training activities of C-DAC are governed and steered by Academic Council (AC) and Academic Management Committee (AMC).
Presently, C-DAC offers its various training programmes through its own training centres in Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mohali, Mumbai, Noida, Pune and Thiruvananthapuram, and its network of Authorised Training Centres (ATC) spread across the country.
The various activities under the umbrella of C-DAC's Education and Training Programmes are described below:
Online Diploma Courses

About Us
Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) is the premier R&D organization of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) for carrying out R&D in IT, Electronics and associated areas.
Different areas of C-DAC, had originated at different times, many of which came out as a result of identification of opportunities.
The setting up of C-DAC in 1988 itself was to built Supercomputers in context of denial of import of Supercomputers by USA. Since then C-DAC has been undertaking building of multiple generations of Supercomputer starting from PARAM with 1 GF in 1988.
Almost at the same time, C-DAC started building Indian Language Computing Solutions with setting up of GIST group (Graphics and Intelligence based Script Technology); National Centre for Software Technology (NCST) set up in 1985 had also initiated work in Indian Language Computing around the same period.
Electronic Research and Development Centre of India (ER&DCI) with various constituents starting as adjunct entities of various State Electronic Corporations, had been brought under the hold of Department of Electronics and Telecommunications (now MeitY) in around 1988. They were focusing on various aspects of applied electronics, technology and applications.
With the passage of time as a result of creative ecosystem that got set up in C-DAC, more areas such as Health Informatics, etc., got created; while right from the beginning the focus of NCST was on Software Technologies; similarly C-DAC started its education & training activities in 1994 as a spin-off with the passage of time, it grew to a large efforts to meet the growing needs of Indian Industry for finishing schools.
C-DAC has today emerged as a premier R&D organization in IT&E (Information Technologies and Electronics) in the country working on strengthening national technological capabilities in the context of global developments in the field and responding to change in the market need in selected foundation areas.
In that process, C-DAC represents a unique facet working in close junction with MeitY to realize nation’s policy and pragmatic interventions and initiatives in Information Technology. As an institution for high-end Research and Development (R&D), C-DAC has been at the forefront of the Information Technology (IT) revolution, constantly building capacities in emerging/enabling technologies and innovating and leveraging its expertise, caliber, skill sets to develop and deploy IT products and solutions for different sectors of the economy, as per the mandate of its parent, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, Government of India and other stakeholders including funding agencies, collaborators, users and the market-place.
